To use this system, the users have to log in your account. In case they don’t have an account yet, they can register on our system. Our system has 6 roles including policy holder, policy owner, dependent, insurance surveyor, insurance manager and admin.
 
Dependent: is allowed to retrieve their claims and their information. After logging in, a window will pop up to show the function for retrieving their claims and their information. The users just need to click on the View Claim button to see the information.

After signing in the system, a window will pop up to ask if the users want to choose view Claims or add a new Claim. If they want to create a new claim, they must provide all of the information required in the system. However, if the claim they want to create is existing, it won’t be created and our system will also notice the users.
